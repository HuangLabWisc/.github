## About
The main goal of our lab is to understand and manipulate biomolecular dynamics by developing and applying novel statistical mechanics based methods that can bridge the gap between experiments and simulations.

Examples of our interested research areas include elucidation of functional conformational changes in gene transcription, elucidation of molecular recognition and self-assembly, development of Markov State Model and Generalized Master Equation model for biomolecular dynamics, development of Integral Equation theories for solvation, and development of deep learning methods to predict protein-ligand and protein-RNA interaction.
